# [0.2.1] - Released

## New Features / Improvements
* [#45](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-data-quality/pull/45) add NOT_BLANK rule

## Fixes
* [#46](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-data-quality/pull/46) make duplicate rule return 0 rows and full count.

## Breaking Changes

## Deprecations

## Known Issues
* incremental validation assumes the table `dq_summary` already exists.

# [0.2.0] - Released

## Highlights
* simplifying arguments requirements in CLI
* CLI now uses default package templates instead of assuming the templates exist in a system path. This makes it easier to deploy the CLI as a single executable across environments.

## New Features / Improvements
* CLI now no longer requires explicitly passing in `--dbt_path` and `--dbt_profiles_dir` arguments. If not present, the CLI will copy a templated `dbt` directory path to the current working directory.
* CLI now defaults to using `dev` dbt profile name for `--environment_target`.

## Fixes
* [#35](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-data-quality/issues/35) incremental validation assumes the table `dq_summary` already exists.

## Breaking Changes
* The top-level `macros` directory is moved into the `dbt` directory. Users should not have to edit this file. However if customization is required, users currently using the top-level`macros` directory should switch to use the path `dbt/macros` instead.
* the file `dbt_project.yml` is now moved into the `dbt` directory. Users should not have to edit this file. However if customization is required, users should switch to use the file located at `dbt/dbt_project.yml` instead.
* `utils.run_dbt()` now expects the first argument `dbt_path` to be provided to the top-level `dbt` directory. This should not affect users since it is not exposed as an user-facing API.

## Deprecations

## Known Issues
* incremental validation assumes the table `dq_summary` already exists.
